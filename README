Hi!

So what is this? It is a library in C for connecting to memcached servers
(http://danga.com/memcached/). It is also a collection of utilities designed
to work with memcached.

memcat - Copy the value of a key to standard output
memflush - Flush the contents of your servers.
memrm - Remove a key(s) from the server.
memstat - Dump the stats of your servers to standard output
memslap - Load generation utility (benchmark!)

The utilities are beta quality at this point. The library is in production
in many locations (upwards to 600 nodes). For networks of more then 512
hosts using consistent hashing, you must update the target WHEEL size for 
number of hosts * 4 in libmemcached/memcached_constants.h. 

Want to contribute? If you write more then three good patches, then I will
just ask you to commit directly to the tree. I am happy to have additional
people work on this project. Please checkout README.FIRST. 

You will need a C99 compiler in order to compile this library. Currently we
actively support Linux, MacOSX, FreeBSD, and Solaris. A Windows port is
currently not supported.
